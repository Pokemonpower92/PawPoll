# PawPoll. 

A cuter, more lovable polling application written to teach myself CRUD philiosphy with a MERN stack. 
I'm also trying to learn a little bit about data visualization with d3.

# Technology
This is a learning project. I used a tech stack that I was personally interested
in learning for personal and professional growth. 

## Backend
The backend is implemented in Node.js using Express. I chose this technology because I have experience 
with js and I really like Express's syntax. 

## Database
I chose a mongodb database for testing and a Mongodb atlas platform for production. 
The atlas db is hosted on AWS. 

## Frontend
This was a no-brainer. I love react and have experience with it already. I use d3-react for data visualization 
and bootstrap-react for some styling elements. 

# Demo
You can find a demo of the application [here](http://paw-poll.herokuapp.com/)
